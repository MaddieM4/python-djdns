# example pymdsfile database file
#
# Each line contains a single record of the form:
# query type answer
#
# query must be either the text that is being looked up OR
# it may be the special symbol @ meaning the empty string
# for when clients query without a hostname (ie, foo.com)
#
# type must be one of A, NS, CNAME, MX, or TXT
#
# answer is the value returned to the client.
#    for A records, it must be a dotter ipv4 address
#    for NS records, it must be a dotted host name
#    for CNAME records, it must be a dotted host name
#    for TXT records, it may be any ASCII string
#    for MX records, it must be a positive integer priority, a colon, and a host name
#
# Multiple records with the same query field may be listed, in which
# case a client making that query will get all of the results listed in
# the order they are listed in this file.
